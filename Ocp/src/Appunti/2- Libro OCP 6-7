############################### CAPITOLO 6 ##################################

java.lang.Throwable
ha due sottoclassi: java.lang.Exception e java.lang.Error
java.lang.RuntimeException estend Exception 

----- UNCHECKED EXCEPTION -----------
Remember that a runtime exception, or UNCHECKED EXCEPTION, may be caught, but it is not required that it be caught. 

----- CHECKED EXCEPTION  ----------
A CHECKED EXCEPTION is any class that extends Exception but is not a runtime exception. Checked exceptions must follow the handle or declare rule where they are either
caught or thrown to the caller.

------ UNCHECKED EXCEPTION OCA  ----------
ArithmeticException Thrown by the JVM when code attempts to divide by zero.

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Thrown by the JVM when code uses an illegal index to access an array.

ClassCastException Thrown by the JVM when an attempt is made to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance.

IllegalArgumentException Thrown by the program to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.

NullPointerException Thrown by the JVM when there is a null reference where an object is required.

NumberFormatException Thrown by the program when an attempt is made.

------ CHECKED EXCEPTION OCP  ----------
java.text.ParseException -    Converting a String to a number.

java.io.IOException
java.io.FileNotFound Exception	  -  Dealing with IO and NIO.2 issues. IOException is the parent class. You can assume any java.io exception is checked.
java.io.NotSerializable Exception

java.sql.SQLException    - Dealing with database issues. SQLException is the parent class. Again, you can assume any java.sql exception is checked.

------ UNCHECKED EXCEPTION OCA  ----------
java.lang.ArrayStoreException  -  Trying to store the wrong data type in an array.

java.time.DateTimeException   -   Receiving an invalid format string for a date.

java.util.MissingResourceException  -   Trying to access a key or resource bundle that does not exist.

java.lang.IllegalStateException 
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException -  Attempting to run an invalid operation in collections and concurrency.

-------- EXAM TRICK ---------------
 Remember to pay attention that throw and throws aren’t reversed in the code that you see on the exam. 
 
It is illegal to declare a subclass exception in a catch block that is lower down in the list than a superclass
exception because it will be unreachable code.

Java will not allow you to declare a catch block for a checked exception type that cannot potentially be thrown by the try clause body.
--------- USING MULTI-CATCH  --------------------------------
